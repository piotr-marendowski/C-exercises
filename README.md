## Notice
Projects mostly have comments describing what is every part of it doing. Some have also description at the bottom, where I put some information about parts worth describing or about some problems ocurred along the way.

I highly encourage you to making the same repository all by yourself, it will help you understand topics described in the book. Feel free to use them and compare to yours. This repository is made by me, while learning how these things work. There are some mistakes, and it's not highly efficient or beautiful written code, but its sole purpose is to learn by doing. Have fun!
