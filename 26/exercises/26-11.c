    /* Solution:
    For a standard binary search algorithm to function correctly
    with a given key, the array only needs to have the elements
    used for comparisons in their proper positions. For example,
    the following partially sorted array will work when the binary
    search is told to look for the key 3:

    1 2 3 4 5 9 8 7 6 10

    The search works because the first and last keys are compared,
    the middle key is computed, and all of the keys in the first half
    of the array are used for comparisons to find 3.
