    \chapter{Note}
    In this material I will go over everything from book,
    trying to summarize every note-worthy subject. I will do
    it, while learning Latex, so good luck to me.

    \section{Steps of Executing a C Program}
    Automated proccess:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\textbf{Preprocessing} - Preprocessor is executing directives
        (they begin with \#).
        \item\textbf{Compiling} - Compiler translates program into machine
        instructions (object code).
        \item\textbf{Linking} - Linker combines object code and code needed
        for execution of the program.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{The Genereral Form of a Simple Program}
    Simple C programs have this form:

    \bigskip
    \textit{directives}
    \smallskip

    \small\texttt{int main(void)} \\
    \small\texttt{\{} \\
    \tab\textit{statements} \\
    \small\texttt{\}}
    \bigskip

    \textbf{Directives} - Begin with '\#' symbol, they state what headers
    include to program.

    % PAGE 5
    \textbf{Functions} - They are segments of code that take arguments, and
    returns (or not) a value. Only \texttt{main} function is required.

    \textbf{Statements} - Commands to execute, mostly end with semicolon.

    \bigskip
    \textbf{String literal} - Series of characters enclosed in double quotation marks,
    e.g. \texttt{"Hello world!"}.

    \textbf{New-line character} - \texttt{\textbackslash n} is an escape sequence, which
    advances to the next line of output.

    \textbf{Comments} - Are ommited in program execution, can be used to comment single line
    e.g. \texttt{/* Comment */}, or block of lines. From C99 we can use one line comments
    e.g. \texttt{// Comment}.

    \section{Variables and Assigments}

    \textbf{Variable} - Place to store calculation's output, for using in future.
    Variable's characteristics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        \textbf{Types} - For now, there are two types of variables:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{int} - Integer types, can store quite big whole number, but
            that depends on your computer's architecture.
            \item \texttt{float} - Can store bigger numbers, as well as digits after
            decimal point.
        \end{itemize}

        \item 
        \textbf{Declarations} - To use a variable, we first need to declare it. It
        means that we need to specify variable's type, and name. We can chain declarations
        with the same type e.g. \texttt{int i, sum, x;}. In C99 they can now be declared
        after statements, not like in C89.
        
        \item
        \textbf{Assignment} - We assign value to a variable. Variable is on the left
        side, while value, expression, formula etc. is on the right side. To assign
        something to a variable, we first need to declare it. Examples:
        \begin{lstlisting}
        int i;
        float f;
        i = 1;
        f = 1.5;
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
